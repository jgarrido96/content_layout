        <b><font size="18">H</font></b>arry Potter is a young wizard born in Godricks Hollow, where his parents were murdered by He Who Must Not Be Named. 
        Raised by his muggle aunt and uncle, he lived a life largely unaware of Wizard kind until he attended Hogwarts.<br>
        Once in school, Harry did a miriad of things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dispatching trolls</li>
            <li>Killing a snake</li>
            <li>Aiding and abetting an escaped criminal</li>
            <li>Illegally entering and competing in the tri-wizard tournament</li>
            <li>Starting a gang under the guize of "Dumbledore's Army"</li>
            <li>Allowing He Who Must Not Be Named to return</li>
            <li>Skipping a whole year to find some guy</li>
        </ul>
        <b><font size="4">O</font></b>ne thing that is interesting, is that Harry Potter was never alone.
        He had the help of a Ronald Weasley, beefcake, and son of Authur Weasley, a ministry employee,
        and one Hermione Granger, muggle born, and top of her the class in almost every metric.

        <b><font size="4">H</font></b>arry Potter would not have been able to do any of the things he is praised for without their help.
        In fact, he most likely wouldn't have been able to do ANY of the things he did without them.
        Between Hermione's curious mind and Ron's intimate knowledge of the Wizarding World,
        they led and, honestly, mentored Harry Potter through most, if not all of his endeavors,
        including his crimes.<br>
        Here we see Harry Potter possibly attempting to get a snake to kill another student:<br>

    <p><b><font size="4">N</font></b>ot all praise Mr Potter so willy nilly. One Severus snape has 
    broken through the illusion. Here he is telling it how it is:</p>
    <img src="Severus-snape1.webp" alt="Good and kind Severus Snape" style="height:200px;">
    <p font-size="1px"><i>Severus Snape, professor and scholar:</i></p>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="Snape_know_it_all.MP3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><font size="4">I</font></b>t seems there's a pattern here, Harry's proxies do most of the work, and Harry Potter
        takes most of the credit. Sure, he killed 'You Know Who' by finding the 7 horcruxes, 
        one of which was Harry himself, ultimately killing the dark wizard with an <i>expelliarmus</i> 
        spell. But ultimately he is just a wizard. With no special talent aside from killing the most 
        powerful wizard of our time and being the only person to survive an Avadakedabra curse. <br>
        <b><font size="4">A</font></b>ll in all it seems that there is not much behind that lightning
        bolt on his forehead. Just a famous boy made famous by others doing. Perhaps we should heed
        Severus when he says:
    </p>

    <p>
        Right you are Severus, right you are.
