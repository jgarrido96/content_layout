            <p>
                Once you've found a genre that suits you, it's time to choose which Instrument
                you'd like to play. There is no wrong answer when choosing an instrument. 
                Many of them are used in most if not all genres of music!
                <ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Guitar</strong>:<img src="purple_guitar.jpg" alt="Purple Electric Guitar" style="height:200px;"><br>One of the most popular instruments in modern music, both acoustic and electric,
                        it's a great choice as an instrument! Guitar mostly plays the melody in a lot of genres and is played by hundreds of millions of musicians.
                        That being said, there's a lot of competition. You'll find that guitarist are "a dime a dozen". It's hard to start a band when everyone plays guitar.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        
                        <strong>Bass</strong>:<img src="blue_bass.jpg" alt="Blue Electric Bass Guitar" style="width:400px;"><br>Another incredibly popular instrument, the bass guitar is the lower alternative to the guitar.
                        The Bass plays the counter melody in a lot of music and is considered part of the rhythm section. The bass is by far one of the most
                        prominent in music, as there are very few genres that don't need or use a bass. Bass players, unlike guitarists, are a lot harder to
                        come by. Bassists are known to be in multiple bands at once at the local level out of sheer necesities. If your goal is to play music
                        as soon and as often as possible, maybe the Bass is the one for you! 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Drums</strong>:<img src="neil_peart_set.webp" alt="Neil Peart's Drumset (RIP)" style="height:200px;"><br>The Drums are considered to be the first instrument humans ever played! Initially using just sticks and animal skins,
                        early civilizations used to sit together and sing, play drums, and dance. Now one of the main proponents of almost every song, the drums is an integral
                        part of music yesterday and today. The drummers job is extremely important. They maintain the time for the whole group, ensuring everyone stays together.
                        Drums is a physically demanding, but rewarding instrument!
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
                This list barely scratches the surface of the amount of instruments in the world. So many instruments to play so many genres. 
                Regardless of the instrument you choose, all it takes is practice and you'll find yourself playing better than you ever imagined!

                groups filled with musicians in your area. If you prefer a more in-person approach, consider going to open mics and chatting with the people playing.
